# Earthquake_Prediction_ML
This is earthquake prediction model combining couple of ML models ,after testing many models and data normalization and pre-processing.
We have used a dataset with 24,000 rows and 5 key attributes.Then we have done pre-processing in which we have cleaned the noise , used simple imputer to impute null values and have set the data to a required format.
Then we have used and visualized our data to get a deep understanding about that and used multiple prediction models and compared their time and performance.
We have took top 2 models as said according to their time and performance and made an ensemble which showed better performance than the single ml models.
